Assignment-1

Operator Overloading, IPv6
In this work we are going to establish some classes and operators which can be used for operations on IPv6 addressing.
Learning Outcomes: On successful completion of this assignment, a student will:
• Write a C++ program that utilizes operator overloading.
• Appreciate the ability to program using notation closer to the target domain.
• Establish a class that can be used for arithmetic operations on binary numbers as well as
IPv6.

Example IPs:
  //1080:0012:3456:789A:0008:0800:200C:417A
		//2080:00FE:3456:789A:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210
